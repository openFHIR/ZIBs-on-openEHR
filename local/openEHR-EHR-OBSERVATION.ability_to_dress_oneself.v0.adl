The following text is copied from the Dutch ZIB model AbilityToDressOneself-v3.1:

Being able to get dressed independently is part of self-care. Limitations in this ability indicate a reduced ability to cope for oneself.
This activity and activities such as those including eating, drinking, and bathing are also known as activities of daily living (ADL). These are the activities people go through in daily life. The extent to which a person is able to do all these activities by themselves is a measure for their total ability to do things independently.

Information on limitations in a patient’s ability to dress themselves is important in determining the nature and intensity of the care the patient needs. In a transfer situation, it gives the receiving organization the ability to anticipate the intensity of the care to be given to the patient, enabling continuity in healthcare for the patient.
If policy has been implemented to improve a patient’s ability to do things independently, the entered extent of independence helps to determine the efficiency of the treatment.

The definitions of the concepts were (partially) taken from the ICNP definitions.
In addition to this information model, there are other tools to record independence, such as the KATZ-ADL and the BarthelIndex. The KATZ-ADL is mainly used for vulnerable seniors and the BarthelIndex is mainly used for patients who have had a stroke.
This information model evaluates the ability to get dressed on a three-point scale. In the KATZ-ADL and in the BarthelIndex, this falls under the aspect of Dressing. In these two tools, the ability is scored on a scale with fewer points.">
